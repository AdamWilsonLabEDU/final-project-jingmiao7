    "text": "Materials\n\nHarmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) dataset\nThe HLS product integrates data from the Landsat 8 (or Landsat 9) and Sentinel-2A (or Sentinel-2B) satellites, producing a harmonized surface reflectance dataset with a 30-meter spatial resolution. Moreover, HLS includes a Quality Assurance (QA) band, which provides data quality filters and masks for clouds, cloud shadows, and water bodies. To generate time series NDVI from HLS dataset, red and near inf-red bands are collected.\n\n\nGeographical location of mangrove samples\nThe geographical information of three mangrove species are collected from Project: The Vegetation of Everglades National Park: Final Report (Spatial Data) (Ruiz and Others 2021). 10 samples of each three mangrove species (red mangrove, white mangrove, and black mangrove) are extracted from this final report.\n\n\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index\nNDVI is widely used to monitor vegetation health and phenological changes over time. The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{NDVI} = \\frac{(NIR - RED)}{(NIR + RED)}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nHarmonic Regression\nHarmonic regression is a statistical technique that fits sine and cosine functions to data and is adept at identifying and modeling the cyclical variations inherent in time series with periodic patterns.\n\n\\[\ny_t = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\left( \\beta_{k} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k t}{T}\\right) + \\gamma_{k} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k t}{T}\\right) \\right) + \\epsilon_t\n\\]\n\n Where:\n\n\\(y_t\\): The observed value at time \\(t\\).\n\\(\\beta_0\\): The intercept or constant term in the model.\n\\(\\beta_k\\): The coefficient for the cosine term corresponding to the \\(k\\)-th harmonic.\n\\(\\gamma_k\\): The coefficient for the sine term corresponding to the \\(k\\)-th harmonic.\n\\(T\\): The period of the data (e.g., the number of days in a year if the data is annual).\n\\(t\\): The time point or index (often representing the day of the year, etc.).\n\\(K\\): The total number of harmonics (sinusoidal terms) included in the model, usually based on the periodicity of the data.\n\\(\\epsilon_t\\): The error term at time \\(t\\), capturing the residual variability in the data that is not explained by the harmonic components."

We observed that many points fall outside the normal range of mangrove NDVI values. These outliers may be caused by cloud cover or water inundation.By observing the current results, the onset time of Red Mangrove appears to be earlier compared to the other two mangrove species."
